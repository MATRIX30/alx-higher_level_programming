# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
`JavaScript`
 - By: Guillaume
 - Weight: 1
 - Project will start Dec 11, 2023 4:00 AM, must end by Dec 12, 2023 4:00 AM
 - Checker was released at Dec 11, 2023 10:00 AM
 - An auto review will be launched at the deadline
 ## Background Context
 JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
